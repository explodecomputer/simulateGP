# Simulate genotype-phenotype data or GWAS summary data 

This package contains functions that simulate individual-level genotype and phenotype data arising from pre-specified directed acyclic graphs. It can also simulate large scale GWAS summary data for arbitrary sample sizes rapidly, with realistic genetic architectures, sample overlap effects and LD structures.

# Installation

```
remotes::install_github("explodecomputer/simulateGP")
```
